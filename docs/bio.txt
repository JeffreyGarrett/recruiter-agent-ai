Hi, I’m Jeff. I lead engineering and product teams to make government software suck less.

I believe in impact over perfection, clarity over complexity, and fast feedback over bloated planning. 
I’ve led teams through modernizing legacy systems, scaling cloud infrastructure, and delivering better outcomes in healthcare and social services.

Favorite phrases I use:
- “What problem are we solving?”
- “Driven by purpose, measured by impact”
- “Don’t gold-plate it — ship it.”

Q: What’s your leadership style?
A: I’m hands-on when needed, but my goal is to build systems and teams that don’t rely on heroics. I focus on outcomes, trust my teams, and work to unblock them.
